    <p>Hey there! My name is Vineeta Jain and I am a Full Stack Developer pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Institute of Engineering & Management, Kolkata. My go-to programming language is JavaScript, front-end library is React and NodeJS on backend. Besides that, I am also proficient in C++. Recently, I have started exploring Computer Vision. Being a self-taught developer, I have learned everything from the people on the Internet. I love learning 📕 and experimenting 🔖 and cooking 🍳 and writing 🖋 and designing 😇 when my code breaks.
